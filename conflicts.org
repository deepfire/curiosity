#+TITLE: Domain conflicts: dependencies and types

* Granularity of Ground
  1. Ground serves several needs:
     - interactivity
       - Parse (hard)
       - Show (hard)
       - Read (soft)
     - transportability
       - Serialise (hard)
     - representability as part of superstructures:
       - either Ord & Eq -- only for Data.Set.Monad
       - or Hashable -- for Data.HashSet
  2. Ord and Eq are hard
